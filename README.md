# Star-Constellation Recognition Project
Overview
Welcome to the Constellation Recognition Project! This project allows users to draw star constellations in a designated window, and the system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and identify the drawn constellation.

Features
Drawing Window: Users can draw constellations using an interactive drawing window.
CNN Recognition: A trained CNN model analyzes the drawn constellations and predicts the most likely constellation name.
User Feedback: The system provides feedback on the recognized constellation, offering additional information or resources.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or find issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Acknowledgments
The project was inspired by a passion for astronomy and a desire to make it accessible through interactive technology.
Special thanks to the contributors and the open-source community.
Feel free to explore the project, contribute, and enjoy drawing and recognizing constellations!
